# TAL CARP 

## Description

An app that automatically calculates the **Computed Air Release Point**, an optimal point to launch an airlift package. Usually, this calculation is made by the use of a “Flight Computer”, a plastic device that gives out certain information to calculate the CARP. The only problem is that the total process might take over an hour, in calculating and drawing the final product. With this app, such task can be performed in seconds.

## Functionalities

→ GUI

→ Parachute wind limits automatically printed to the final document

→ .exe file for running on devices without Python installed (pyinstaller)

## Next Improvements

→ Optimize app launch time (usually takes a few seconds until the GUI is launched)

→ Add a calculation for multiple parachute launch
